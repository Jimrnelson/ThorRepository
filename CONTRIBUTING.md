# How to contribute to Thor Repository

## Bug report?
- Please check [issues](https://github.com/VFPX/ThorRepository/issues) if the bug is reported
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## New version
Here are the steps to updating to a new version:

* Make whatever changes are necessary.
* Update or recreate Source\Thor_Repository.zip: it should contain the contents of the Source
* Update the version number at the top of README.md and describe the changes in the What's New section near the bottom.
* Update the version number in Source\ThorRepositoryVersionFile.txt
