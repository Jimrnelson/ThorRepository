### Tool: Find Objects

#### Purpose:

Dialog for searching through all objects in a form or class based on the values of any of their properties.

Searching could, for instance, find all non-default ControlSources, all objects of a particular class or parent class, all captions that have the word 'Description', etc.  The search expression can be any valid FoxPro expression, and can reference any possible property or method names.  (The form includes directions on how it can be used.)

The result is shown in a grid, one row per object found, allowing editing of individual properties or methods of those objects, by double clicking on them.  You can also double-click on the property name to select that object in the form or class being edited.


#### Usage:
1. (optional) -- highlight text to be searched for.
1. Call this tool (it opens GF for you)
2. Save and close the SCX / VCX you are editing (GF cannot search it if it's open.)
3. Run GF
4. Call this tool again (restores GF to its prior state)
